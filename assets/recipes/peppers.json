Delicious! \nSo I like many others here initially thought it was too much liquid. It was not. It DID have to cook much longer than 20 minutes however. The liquid WILL reduce (go watch tv or something). P.S. it will also take much longer in the oven, unless you like a raw pepper.\n\nI do not measure my seasonings... I sprinkle until it feels right and then I taste throughout the cooking and add more if necessary (it was totally necessary).\n\nThe only adjustments to the core recipe I'd make is.. put some cheese in the pepper first, meat filling then cheese it again. Also cover the dish in the oven so the peppers could steam. When you can pierce side of pepper with fork easily, uncover and let cheese brown.\n\nThis was amazing. My only issue now is... can I have another one?","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-01-21","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"RedCocktail"},"reviewBody":"Definitely needs more time to cook.

The meat mixture was a bit watery so I think I would drain the tomatoes next time.  I did not use the green onion garnish.  I also learned that red and green peppers have fewer carbs than yellow peppers.

I'm currently making this recipe and can not recommend it.  I followed the recipe by the book.  Using TWO cups of broth leaves you with chili soup...it will not simmer down and thicken in 20 minutes.  I drained as much liquid as I could and ended up adding the cheese to the chili mixture to thicken it up.  As for the spices, even with that amount of spice, the filling doesn't really stand out...in other words, I thought it somewhat bland.\n\nIMHO...Makenzie Gore probably copied a recipe from another website and tried to change the ingredients a bit to make it unique to Delish.  To get what you have in the photo, you'd have to omit the broth.  That is where I made my mistake.  The filling was just fine with the tomatoes and their juices.  Adding the broth?  A BIG MISTAKE.  I ended up simmering for 40 minutes in the vain hope I'd have something more than really soupy chili. I am currently drinking the chili broth...waste not, want not.","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":1,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}}],"recipeCategory":["gluten-free","low-carb","low sugar","weeknight meals","dinner","main dish","meat"],"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"330 calories"},"recipeYield":"8 servings","description":"If you're on a Keto diet, then you will love these Keto Stuffed Peppers.
